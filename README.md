# The_Portfolio

## Description
- The task: "Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies."

## Requirements
* Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects
* Use React
* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages
* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 
* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages
* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects
* Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

## Instructions
* [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)
* [Design](#design)
* [React](#react)
* [Updated LinkedIn Profile](#updated-linkedin-profile)

### Updated Portfolio
Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:
* Your name
* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
* A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects
* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:
  * Project title
  * Link to the deployed version
  * Link to the GitHub repository
  * GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

#### Design
As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:
* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
* If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note 
that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge.
